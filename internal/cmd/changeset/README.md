# Changeset

The `rain deploy` command creates and executes a changeset under the hood, but
doesn't allow you to directly interact with it. The `rain changeset` command in
combination with `rain ls` and `rain rm` provide full access to changeset functionality.

To list all changesets or show details about a single changeset, use the `rain ls` command.

To create or update a changeset, use the `rain changeset` command.

To delete a changeset, use the `rain rm` command.
