If ``none`` is specified, then IPC resources within the containers of a task are private and not shared with other containers in a task or on the container instance. If no value is specified, then the IPC resource namespace sharing depends on the Docker daemon setting on the container instance. For more information, see [IPC settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#ipc-settings---ipc) in the *Docker run reference*.

    /// The process namespace to use for the containers in the task. The valid values are ``host`` or ``task``. On Fargate for Linux containers, the only valid value is ``task``. For example, monitoring sidecars might need ``pidMode`` to access information about other containers running in the same task.
    ///    ///  If ``host`` is specified, all containers within the tasks that specified the ``host`` PID mode on the same container instance share the same process namespace with the host Amazon EC2 instance.
    ///  If ``task`` is specified, all containers within the specified task share the same process namespace.
    ///  If no value is specified, the default is a private namespace for each container. For more information, see [PID settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#pid-settings---pid) in the *Docker run reference*.
